# DL_assignemnt
Here, we are using a neural network with 16 units using nn.Linear module. We are using the ReLU activation function. The output layer uses the sigmoid function.
The training data is generated using the first and second input features greater than 0 and then stochastic gradient descent is used for weight optimization. The loss function used is from nn.BCELoss works by computing entropy loss between the predicted and true labels.

To plot the graph, training loss and test loss after each epoch is taken. The y-axis represents loss and the x-axis represents the iterations.

Running the code:
*Import the specified modules which include a few pytorch modules
*Run the code
*To generate different types of training data, the parameters in the 'Generate some training and test data' section can be modified.
